This blog was created out of need to document my thoughs, projects and ideias to my friends and family.Through all my years, out of necessity i built project or solved problems  and never documented them.

While growing up i always asked everyone on the **why** of things, and quickly, i concluded that people do not care about the **whys**. I believe on understanding the **why**, because after deeper understanding, the solution becomes obvious and you gain another tool in your belt.

The desire of this blog is share the solutions to the world and feed the hunger of **whys** of everyone that needs it, like who i was in the past.

King regards,
