While growing up i always asked everyone on the why of things, and quickly, i concluded that people do not care about the whys. I believe on understanding the why, because after deeper understanding, the solution becomes obvious and you gain another tool in your belt. The desire of this blog is share the solutions to the world and feed the hunger of whys of everyone that needs it, like who i was in the past.
